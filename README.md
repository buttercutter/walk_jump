# walk_jump

A simple implementation of [Protein Discovery with Discrete Walk-Jump Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12360)

NOTE: 
- The validation losses for both EBM and denoiser modules are 0.01 (uses MSE loss) and 0.13 (uses cross-entropy loss) respectively.
- Previous code commmit history is found [here](https://gist.github.com/buttercutter/7b99cfff0a2d48f9c8befeadee6dd54e)
- See a bit of theory study [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i4pxy2aJgflMYctFgh9kRZipExLhaIjX/view?usp=sharing)

TODO: 
- Needs to revise the inference code
- Adapts the code for [BEND benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12570)
